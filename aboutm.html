Fusion Factory sprouted from an awareness that science is not simply a collection or words and facts in a textbook: it is a visceral, creative and constantly evolving set of information. Fusion Factory is a collection of workshops latching onto this engaging principal to bring to secondary school students a creative medium for them to grasp the reality and practicality of science. We see ourselves as an adjunct friend of established teaching methods, drawing on our combined science communication backgrounds to elucidate aspects and areas of science that may otherwise remain elusive to students. Fusion Factory thus abridges the distance between school and third-level science scholarship, presenting to students a glimpse into the exciting possibility of third-level study whilst simultaneously fulfilling their immediate educational needs.
