	Fusion Factory can provide a tailored set of stations for your school in both junior and senior cycle versions. We provide students with an engaging medium through which to grasp the more tricky elements of science curricula. We can accommodate your school for either a half or a full day and provide Fusion Factory to a range of your students. Half day events take the form of a single 3-hour session, and full day events consist of two 3-hour sessions throughout the school day.
</p>
<p class="smallp">
	For junior cycle students we offer a range of stations concerning Biology/Physics/Chemistry, and can provide a quick-paced and fun session enabling students to overcome any syllabus-related difficulties within these scientific disciplines. The choice of stations can be decided upon by the school, allowing for a specialised approach, meeting the educational needs of your school. Through creative and engaging pursuits students will also begin to recognise the dependency of any of these areas of science on the other two, and fundamental cohesion that scientific enquiry entails. We also work to engage students with thoughts of taking on science subjects into the Leaving Certificate and beyond.
	</p>
<p class="smallp">
	Our senior cycle approach consists of students engaging with three of our stations (again, to be chosen by the school), a lecture and a seminar/tutorial. Through these three different elements we give senior cycle students insight into third level scientific study - prompting further interest. We also address immediate educational requirements, focusing on problem-areas within the syllabus. The lecture and tutorial present the student with a real experiential experience regarding further study and what studying science at third level really entails.
</p>
<p class="smallp">
	Through our low administration fee, the choice of stations can be adjusted and tailored to suit individual school needs and we can take on all timetabling logistics. The overall cost of a full day event works on a sliding scale dependent on the total number of students and can range from 550 to 850 Euro, with most schools having an estimated cost of 700 Euro figure for a full day event, based on average class size statistics. The administration fee represents an additional charge of 100 Euro to cover all secretarial and paperwork, along with facilitating our customised approach to schools and station. In addition to our Fusion Factory events we also offer teacher packs for lasting teacher/classroom support which elaborates on the material covered whilst simultaneously providing activities to assist in other scientific areas.
