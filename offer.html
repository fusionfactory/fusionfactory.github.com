	Fusion Factory can provide a tailored set of stations for your school in both junior and senior cycle versions. We provide students with an engaging medium through which to grasp the more tricky elements of science curricula. We can accommodate your school for either a half or a full day and provide Fusion Factory to a range of your students. Half day events take the form of a single 3-hour session, and full day events consist of two 3-hour sessions throughout the school day.
</p>
<p class="smallp">
	For junior cycle students we offer a range of stations concerning Biology/Physics/Chemistry, and can provide a quick-paced and fun session enabling students to overcome any syllabus-related difficulties within these scientific disciplines. The choice of stations can be decided upon by the school, allowing for a specialised approach, meeting the educational needs of your school. Through creative and engaging pursuits students will also begin to recognise the dependency of any of these areas of science on the other two, and fundamental cohesion that scientific enquiry entails. We also work to engage students with thoughts of taking on science subjects into the Leaving Certificate and beyond.
	</p>
<p class="smallp">
	Our senior cycle approach consists of students engaging with three of our stations (again, to be chosen by the school), a lecture and a seminar/tutorial. Through these three different elements we give senior cycle students insight into third level scientific study - prompting further interest. We also address immediate educational requirements, focusing on problem-areas within the syllabus. The lecture and tutorial present the student with a real experiential experience regarding further study and what studying science at third level really entails.
</p>
<p class="smallp">
The choice of stations can be adjusted and tailored to suit individual school needs and we take on all timetabling logistics as part of our fee, and our charges are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
&#8226; &#8364;300 for a half-day event. 3 hours long, with a limit of 50 students.
<br/>
&#8226; &#8364;500 for a full-day event. 6 hours long, with a limit of 100 students.<br/><br/>
We may be able to cater for upwards of 100 students over the course of the day, but this may effect the overall cost. Inclusive of this cost is all materials and secretarial work, along with facilitating our customised approach to schools and stations.
<br/><br/>
