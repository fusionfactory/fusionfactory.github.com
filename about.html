          <h1>About Fusion Factory</h1>
<br/>
					<p>Fusion Factory sprouted from an awareness that science is not simply a collection or words and facts in a textbook: it is a visceral, creative and constantly evolving set of information. Fusion Factory is a collection of workshops latching onto this engaging principal to bring to secondary school students a creative medium for them to grasp the reality and practicality of science. We see ourselves as an adjunct friend of established teaching methods, drawing on our combined science communication backgrounds to elucidate aspects and areas of science that may otherwise remain elusive to students. Fusion Factory thus abridges the distance between school and third-level science scholarship, presenting to students a glimpse into the exciting possibility of third-level study whilst simultaneously fulfilling their immediate educational needs. 
          </p>

<p>
	Fusion Factory began mid 2011 and it’s striking originality and promise was endorsed by the RDS through their Science Live Demonstration Lecture Series which issued us a grant to bring Fusion Factory to the RDS and two other schools nationwide. With an extremely positive response from the two schools that partook in our RDS event in addition to a pilot at Trinity College Dublin’s Science Gallery we are now seeking to bring Fusion Factory to schools across the Greater Dublin area.

            <h2>Luke</h2>
            <p>I have two years Computer Science study experience and currently undertaking study in English Literature. With over two years experience in science communication I have developed a deep interest in pedagogy, lending itself communication outreaches such as guest lectureship and publication. I enjoy taking an avant-garde approach to science communication and educational processes, and represents one of the primary reasons for my involvement in Fusion Factory, which I believe adheres to this experimental, fun and unique philosophy.

            <h2>Rosie</h2>
            <p>I completed my degree in Zoology in Trinity College Dublin in 2010. Whilst studying I began teaching Piano in a Dublin secondary school, and have been doing so now for the past four years thoroughly enjoying it! I have three years experience working in the field of science communication, explaining current and debatable revelations in science to the general public, including audiences of all ages. My communication experience has enabled me to develop teaching strategies that work in conjunction with the students’ personalities and interests, inspiring them through enthusiasm, creativity and fun! At its core, I believe Fusion Factory is fully realising the teaching values and articulation of science which should be striven for through regular teaching methods.
