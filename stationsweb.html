            <h3>Bloody Biology</h3>
            <p>Ever wanted to analyse blood?  In this activity, you take on a role of doctor, nurse or lab technician and work with your team to figure out patient conditions.  Provided with custom-made medical handbooks, patient histories and real lab equipment, including blood smears, can you figure out which patient has a highly contagious infection?  Will you cure or kill your patients?  Try your hand at medicine here!</p>

            <h3>Elemental Chemistry</h3>
            <p>Riddle me this: What pungent element stinks out the kitchen if a gone-off egg breaks?  What is the next door neighbour to Zirconium that makes up one of the most powerful natural magnets?  Our periodic table is missing some of its marbles and it’s up to you to put together the objects in their places by following clues.</p>

            <h3>Enviro-Keys</h3>
            <p>You are out in the wilderness one day and come across a creature that you don’t recognise.  The lab team back home are trying to identify it from your description.  Can they figure it out in under 20 questions?  Do you know your biotics from your biomes, fauna from flora, and can you explain why a plant would develop a taste for flesh?  If not, then allow us to take you on a trip through taxonomy and classification of organisms.</p>

            <h3>Lemon-Aid</h3>
            <p>I get by with a little help from my... veg?  Get to crocodile grips with electricity by creating a fruity circuit.  Try your hand at some DIY technology, using mainly household items, to power a light or charge a clock while learning about fantastical physics.<br/><br/></p>

            <h3>The Energy Debate</h3>
            <p>We are killing the planet slowly but surely, it seems.  Carbon footprints, water shortages, what next?  Are there ways of living and using energy that don’t destroy our environment?  Alternative energy sources have been suggested for years as possible replacements for oil, gas and peat in our lives.  Here, you can show off your debating skills, speed-reading ability or talent for tearing down bad arguments in a battle of logic, reason and information.</p>
