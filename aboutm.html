Fusion Factory sprouted out of an awareness that science is far more than the words in a text book and that there is space in the education environment for more creative and engaging methods of science learning. While text books are great resources for study and while the classroom environment facilitates curriculum learning, Fusion Factory sees itself as an adjunct friend of established teaching methods and elucidates aspects of science that may otherwise remain elusive to students. Fusion Factory thus abridges the distance between school and third-level science scholarship. Following months of brainstorming and devising countless exciting ideas, we received support from the Royal Dublin Society last summer to bring our workshops to the RDS.
