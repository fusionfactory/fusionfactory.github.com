	Fusion Factory is a collection of workshops, lectures and tutorials designed to bring to secondary school students a new manner in which to attain scientific literacy. Through our creative, interactive and genuinely enjoyable set of stations, students learn through their creativity. Our lectures and tutorials pave an experiential path for students to imagine further study within scientific disciplines. We see ourselves as an adjunct friend of established teaching methods and we draw on our combined science communication backgrounds and our specialised approach to both Junior and Senior cycle students elucidates aspects and areas of science that may otherwise remain elusive. Fusion Factory thus abridges the distance between school and third-level science scholarship, presenting to students a glimpse into the exciting possibility of third-level study whilst simultaneously fulfilling their immediate educational needs. With support and encouragement from teachers, students and lecturers, it is clear that our theory and application is successful and represents a true, and viable, 21st century educational model.

	<span style="font-weight:bold;">The evolution of Fusion Factory thus far:</span><br/>

	Fusion Factory began mid 2011 and it's striking originality and promise was endorsed by the RDS through their Science Live Demonstration Lecture Series which issued us a grant to bring Fusion Factory to the RDS and two other schools nationwide. With an extremely positive response from the two schools that partook in our RDS event in addition to a successful pilot at Trinity College Dublinâ€™s Science Gallery we are now seeking to bring the working Fusion Factory model to schools throughout the Greater Dublin area.
